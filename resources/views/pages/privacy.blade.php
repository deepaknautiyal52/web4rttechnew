          This Privacy Policy explains what information Web4rtTech collects through this website,
          why we collect it, and how we handle it. We only collect what's actually needed to
          respond to your inquiries and run this website.
        </p>

        <div class="legal-disclaimer">
          <strong>Note:</strong> This is a general template written to accurately describe how
          this Site currently operates. It has not been drafted or reviewed by a lawyer. Before
          relying on it for a live business — especially one serving clients in regions with
          specific privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) — please have it reviewed by a qualified
          legal professional.

          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We collect information in two ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Contact &amp; quote form submissions:</strong> when you fill out our
              contact/quote form, we collect your name, email address, phone number, company
              name, the service you're interested in, budget range, timeline, subject, and
              message.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Admin access:</strong> our internal team uses a password-protected admin
              login to review submissions. We do not collect any personal information from
              general visitors browsing the public site beyond what's submitted through the
              contact form.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>Information submitted through our contact form is used only to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Respond to your inquiry and discuss your project</li>
            <li>Follow up with a quote or additional questions if needed</li>
            <li>Keep an internal record of leads and client communications</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your information to third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
          <p>
            Contact form submissions are stored in our secured database, accessible only to
            authenticated administrators through a password-protected admin panel. We take
            reasonable technical measures to protect this information, but no method of
            transmission or storage over the internet is 100% secure.
          </p>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>4. Cookies &amp; Local Storage</h2>
          <p>
            The public website does not currently use tracking or advertising cookies. Our admin
            panel uses your browser's local storage to keep you signed in during an admin
            session — this is not shared with or accessible to other websites. See our 
            <a href="{{ url('/cookies') }}">Cookie Policy</a> for more detail.

          <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            We do not currently use third-party analytics or advertising tools (such as Google
            Analytics) on this Site. If that changes in the future, we will update this policy
            to describe what's added and how it affects your data.

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain contact form submissions for as long as needed to respond to your inquiry
            and maintain reasonable business records. If you'd like your information removed
            sooner, contact us using the details below and we'll act on your request.
